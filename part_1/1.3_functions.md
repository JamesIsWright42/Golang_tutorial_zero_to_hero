# Functions 
Every single program that you will write has a purpose. It is meant to perform some action and have some result. Let's take a look at our familiar and favorite _Hello WOrld_ program. Again, please navigate to [go playground](https://play.golang.org/). Where do you see the functions in this program? 

The most important function in any program in the *main* function. This is the function that actually executes our the program. The _Hello World_ main function is defined like this. 
```bash 
func main() {
	fmt.Println("hello, payground")
)
}
``` 
In Go a main function is always defined by the line `func main(){}`. Whatever is found the `{}` is what the function executes. Inside the main function there is one line that calls a predefined function. This is a function that in inherent to Go. The [`Println` function](https://godoc.org/fmt#Println) is part of the `fmt` package. It accepts an argument and prints that argument to the programs available standard output. An argument is just whatever happens to be found inside the parentheses. AS you can see functions are used all the time. In Go we have to use two just to print out a sentence. As you develop your skills writing functions will become second nature to you. 

_In this case we have the `string` "hello,playgroud". Standard out is the output for what ever environment the program was run in. In [go playground](https://play.golang.org) it is the white space below, for web pages this is the browser console, for locally run go programs it will be your terminal._


### Writing your own functions 
Developers write their own functions for several reasons. One very important reason is to organize the code. The more complex an application gets the more processes that the application needs to run. If all of the code related to a single process in a function it is much easier to read and understand. 

To start go again to the [go playground](https://play.golang.org/).
