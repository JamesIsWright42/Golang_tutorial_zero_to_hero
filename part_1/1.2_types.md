# Types in Golang
In the first exercise we printed out a statement. This statement has a certain type; it was a `string`. `Strings` are generally anything that we consider to be written word, or plain English. 

### Basic Types

They are other variable types that come up quite often when you write go code. Here is a list of basic types: 
-`string`: A statement or sentence. This us denoted by a set of quotes `""` or `''`
-`char`: A single letter or character. This is denoted by a set of quotes `''`. example: `'a'`
-`byte`: Hexidecimal values used to express information. example: `bd b2 3d bc 20 e2 8c 98`
-`int`: A positive or negative number that does not contain a decimal. The max value for an `int` can be `1*10^15 - 1` and the min is `-1*10^15 - 1`
-`double`: A positive or negative number that contains up to two decimal points. 
-`float32`: Any number more complex than and `int` or `double`.
-`bool`: Stores a state of condition. It can be either `true` or `false`.
-`error`: `stores error messages that alert the developer to broken code. 

There are many more go types than that, but these are the ones that you will most often be exposed to as a golang developer. 

### Using types

- examples with each type

So let's dive back into it. If you nagivate back to [go playgrounds](https://play.golang.org/) to get started. 

Inside the main function go ahead a type the following:
```bash 
var str = "hello world!"
```
This linbe defines the variable _str_ of type `string`. We can use this variable as any other string. Go ahead and replace the phrase `"Hello, playground!"` with our new variable _str_. Your main function should now look like this:
```bash
func main() {
	var str = "hello world!"
	fmt.Println(str)
}
```
_If your spacing is off you can press the `format` button at the top of the screen. This will give your code standard goang formatting._

Let's run the code and see what happens. Yay it prints. 

What else can we define. 
- assigning types
- miss assignment
- protected values
