For your first Go program it make a lot of sense to cover a really important topic, servers. Your programs or apps are always going to need to be in contact with other programs. Servers are used to make these connections and send information across them. This exercise will be modeled off of a repo that I wrote previously as a [coding challenge](https://github.com/Soypete/goChatter) that was part of a job interview. I am using it without any changes because it is beginner code. I wrote this program after 5 months programming experience.
